I created a website that is about Pottery. 
All navigation buttons are active. I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and Ajax GET function during the project. 
The hardest part of the project is to use the Ajax GET function. I called a file that I created as a JSON file in order to use GET function.
The coolest part of the project was using D3 graph. 
Overall, I learned the basics of web development.
