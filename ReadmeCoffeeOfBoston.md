   Navigation bar has container,navbar-toggler,navbar-brand, nav-item, collapse, dropdown. you do not need to click News tab for
   dropdown features because dropdown feature works automaticaly.
   I add slide in homepage with Carousel feature and it automaticaly works.
   I added contaoner ,row and column features to show other branches and these coloums have click button to show location of Branches
   I added hover effects on pictures. Also homepage has footer and form.
   The last feature is ajax feature which has server.js, launch.json,and user.json servers.
   You can call information of all stores via get button.
