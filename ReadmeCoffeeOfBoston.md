I made a coffee shop webpage for the final project.
I would like to explain my webpage features.
My webpage consists of Home, About, Sign in, and News tabs and all of these tabs support desktop and phone software with bootsrapt4 features.

  Navigation bar has container,navbar-toggler,navbar-brand, nav-item, collapse, dropdown. you do not need to click the News tab for dropdown features because dropdown feature works automatically.
   I added the slide in homepage with Carousel feature, and it automatically works.
   I put container, row and column features to show other branches. These columns have click button to show the location of Branches via google maps. 
   I added hover effects on pictures. Also homepage has footer and form.
   The last feature is ajax feature which has server.js, launch.json, and user.json servers.
   You can call success information of all stores via get button.
   
   
   I added youtube video with iframe feature in about tab.
   in additional, I put some pictures with information about other branches
   
   Sign in the tab has create an account features and D3 Bar Chart.
    The last one is News tab which has the connection with News web pages around the world.
